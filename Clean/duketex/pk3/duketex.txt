* Description *

This is a complete conversion of all textures from the "Duke Nukem - Atomic Edition"
working with the standard doom palette. It covers everything from space base textures
over bio-flesh stuffage to city like downtown walls. The wad itself has about 850 new
textures and over 200 new flats making it a total count of more than 1000 new textures,
enough resources to build a complete map based on this resource pack! Good luck while
trying ;)
