Editor(s) used          : -Paint Shop Pro and Animation Shop by Jasc
Known Bugs              : Browns fading to Red, bright blues fading to
                          grey.. yeah, but it's a colormap bug by ID,
                          fixing this would, IMO, require a completely new
                          pallette. Use some opengl ports to eliminate this
                          (like Gzdoom, Jdoom, EDGE, Legacy etc.)
May Not Run With...     : I dunno
