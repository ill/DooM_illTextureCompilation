Description             : 152 textures & 59 flats converted to Doom 2. I've
                          also been friendly enough to insert an ANIMDEFS
                          lump which gives a 'quake swirl' animation to the
                          two slime textures under Zdoom.
Additional Credits to   : ID for the great Doom and Quake series. Iikka
			  "Fingers" Keränen for creating the textures in
