# DooM_illTextureCompilation
A compilation of various zdoom compatible texture packs into one giant pack, all cleaned and ready to go. Should be a good base for projects as you develop, and then use a cleanup tool to remove unneeded textures once you're ready to release. Most of these are curated/recovered from Realm667.

The original info files are all included internally by the original authors of the various texture packs.  At this time I take no credit for any textures myself, but I may add some of my own here in the future.  I take credit for the hard work it took to compile this massive pack and make sure there aren't any conflicts or redundant entries and that it works as correctly and smoothly as possible in GZDoom and SLADE.  I also wrote some new ZDoom Texture management tools for SLADE to help create this pack.

You should be able to add the pk3 folder as a resource when working with doom builder or other similar editors.

When you're ready to release your map pack that uses these textures, clean up the unneeded textures using the latest version of SLADE.
