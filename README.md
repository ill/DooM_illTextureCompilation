# DooM_illTextureCompilation
A compilation of various zdoom compatible texture packs into one giant pack, all cleaned and ready to go. Should be a good base for projects as you develop, and then use a cleanup tool to remove unneeded textures once you're ready to release. Most of these are curated/recovered from Realm667.

You should be able to add the pk3 folder as a resource when working with doom builder or other similar editors.

When you're ready to release your map pack that uses these textures, clean up the unneeded textures using the latest version of SLADE.
Archive -> Maintenance -> Remove Unused ZDoomTextures.
